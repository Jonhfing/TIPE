# TIPE
Personal python project about optimal O(n2) solutions to NxN sized Tic Tac Toe
If you have any question, feel free to contact me.

This project does 3 things :
  1) Provide a tool to remotely play NxN Tic Tac Toe where N is any strictly positive integer (same as regular tic tac toe, except you must do a row, column or diagonal of N of        your symbols to win).
  2) Provide several "AI" to play with (they are algorithms which each use a different strategy to find on which square to play given a specific grid state). Please note that all      algorithms are deterministic, except for "Random" (duh) and "Malin" which both explicitly use the Random function.
  3) Provide functions to, for a given face of, extract statistics and draw graphs of the average number of wins as a function of grid size (N). The graphs part uses pyplot.

This was later used to analyse the algorithms efficacity. If you want to know more about the experiences and their results, again, feel free to reach out !
